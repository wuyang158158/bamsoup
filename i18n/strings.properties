Home p2=White Paper

Home p3=Telegram

Idbook p1=IDBOOK is essentially a decentralized book which use blockchain to record how individuals interact with one another and organizations. This system is much like the blockchain version of Facebook and people from different parts of the world have equal access to it.

Idbook p3=Users’ identity won’t be restricted by regional laws.

Idbook p4=Users’ can use their own identity data freely anywhere and anytime.

Idbook p5=

Idbook p6=Users’ identity will be recorded on IDBOOK by consensus.

Idbook p7=

Problem p1=The Problems We Are Facing

Problem p2=Refugees Are Losing Their Identities

Problem p3=In Syria, more than one in ten refugees were displaced because of war and have lost their nationality and residence registration. Their basic civil rights, such as social security, education, residency and voting rights, have been written off. All these situations make them unable to move to modern society.

Problem p4=Technology Giants Are Monopolizing Internet Services And Users’ Privacy

Problem p5=A British consultancy has managed to get more than 87 million users’ data from Facebook, which has even affected the US election.  The disclosure of personal data from the centralized giants and the Internet private model has become an unavoidable malady.

Problem p6=1.1 Billion Invisible People

Problem p7=According to the statistics released by World Bank, over 1.1 billion people in the world have no formal status or lack of official identification, and therefore they have no access to public health care, education and financial services. Most of these "invisible people" are concentrated in Asia and Africa, and more than one-third are children.

Problem p8=Identity Fraud has Became The Norm of ICO Projects

Problem p9=Fraudulent teams and celebrities endorsements continue to proliferate. Initiators are unable to self-certify the true existence of team members, making the blockchain industry and ICO activities infamous, and the overall environment trust is extremely lacking.

FQA p1=1. What is IDBOOK？

FQA p2=IDBOOK is a peer-to-peer digital identity system which reconstructs the trust relationship between people and people,  and people and organization. IDBook dedicates to construct a new structure of social division of labor.

FQA p3=Want to know more？Please check

FQA p4= IDBOOK whitepaper for more details.

FQA p5=2. What is the mission of IDBOOK?

FQA p6=Ensuring Security and Authenticity of the User's Identity.

FQA p7=DataReturn identity value to the users: IDBOOK has established a complete personal identification protocol, so that each person's identity data only belongs to himself. Users’ identity data are protected and any third parties could not get users’ identity data without permission. IDBOOK is using this protocol to combat with centralized organization for data leakage.

FQA p8=IDBOOK invites organization to be set up on the blockchain and uses Tokens to incentive individuals and organizations to record their relationships into the distributed and open ledger. IDBOOK dedicates to build a new society of individuals and organization on the blockchain. 

FQA p9=Open Dapp portal to encourage developers to design a variety of Dapp based on the features of IDBOOK. Those Dapp could be adapted to various scenes in social life and overturn the traditional personal identity usage model.

FQA p10=3. What is ID Bucks？

FQA p11=ID Bucks(Trade mark：IDB）The only token to motivate people to use and maintain the IDBOOK network. IDB could be obtained through identity exchanging between users and could be used to pay for services provided by nodes.

FQA p12=4. How to acquire IDB？

FQA p13=Users could purchase IDB on authorited exchanges or get certain amount of IDB from identity exchange. 

FQA p14=IDB's mining total is 10.2 billion. After the mainnet launched, IDB unlock 1%.The unlocked IDB tokens are no longer generated if they have been released in an identity collision.The next user's product condition is reached, triggering the new IDB to be unlocked.

FQA p15=5. What is MANA？

FQA p16=MANA is the unit of measuring the value of an identity. When people try to quantify the value of a person's identity, we need to collect their degree of participation in society to evaluate their social influence.In a broader context, the term MANA is close to influence, fame, social skills, connections and popularity. 

FQA p17=The MANA value will be raised accordingly in the process of first time identity exchange or identity authentication.

FQA p18=The MANA value will directly affect the amount of IDB obtained by each user in the ID exchange process. 

FQA p19=6. What qualifications does organization/institutional need to provide？

FQA p20=Any institution or individual could apply for becoming node on IDBOOK. Non-registered Organization needs to provide information for verification when applies to become node of IDBOOK, and certain amount of IDB need to be locked as deposit. 

FQA p21=After becoming node, organizations could provide individual users with identity authentication and other services. Also, those organizations will be responsible for data storage of IDBOOK, and to reach consensus about personal data with other nodes on the blockchain.

FQA p22=7. Could I develop an Dapp on IDBOOK？ What could I get？

FQA p23=As an open source public blockchain, users and organizations could develop Dapp on IDBOOK chain freely. And all Dapp could be logged in by the ID set up on IDBOOK. 

FQA p24=By contributing to the IDBOOK eco-system, developers will be rewarded.
